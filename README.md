# numpy
# generating data
import numpy as np 
arr=np.array([1,2,3]) it can gernerate a 1D array.
arr=np.arrange(0,10,2) it can gernerate a array with a fixed-step.
arr.reshape(m,n) itcan transform a matrix into the size m*n.
arr=np.zeros((3,3)) it can initialize a matrix with 0.
arr=np.ones((3,3)) it can initialize a matrix with 1.
arr=np.random.randint(0,10,(3,3)) it can gernerate a  3*3 matrix randomly between 0 and 10.
arr=np.linspace(0,100,100) it can generate a specified size array with fixed-step.
# matrix operation
for vectors' inner product:np.dot()
for the element-wise product of matrixs:np.multiply(A,B) or A*B
for matrixs multiply:np.matmul(A,B) or A@B
for matrixs transpositionï¼š A.T 
for matrix shape: A.shape[1]
# sliceing
sliceing can get a part of a matrix.
arr[:1,:] is the first line of arr.
arr[:,:1] is the first column of arr.
the two sides of : is the position of sliceing.  
e.g.arr[2:3,:] is the third line of arr. and their default value are 0 and len(arr) respectively. 
# array properties
arr.max() arr.argmax() can get the maximum value and its index of arr.
arr.mean() can get the average value of arr.
arr.std() arr.var()  can get the standard deviation and variance of arr.
